TB_CircularSlider
=================
You can find a Swift version of this tutorial ![here](http://www.thinkandbuild.it/building-a-custom-and-designabl-control-in-swift/)

This is the code for the tutorial "How to create a custom control in iOS" from http://www.thinkandbuild.it.

In this tutorial I show how to create a custom control as subclass of UIControl and I draw the 99% of the component using Core Graphics. 

Here a preview of the control built in this tutorial:
